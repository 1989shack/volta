- windows needs to find the executables in a different location than unix
- windows: need to differentiate .exe and .cmd -- two different binstub executables
- figure out how we want to combine io::Error and reqwest::Error and ZipError
  - just use io::Error and wrap reqwest errors with io::Error::new()?
  - or look into error-chain?
- unix bash install script
- add UI to windows installer
- appveyor tests
- appveyor deploy script:
  - generate msi with wix toolset
    - `candle -ext WixUtilExtension support\windows\Nodeup.wxs`
    - `light -ext WixUtilExtension Nodeup.wixobj`
  - publish to GitHub release
- travis tests
- travis deploy script
- try to get zip-rs to land https://github.com/mvdnes/zip-rs/pull/37
- proper behavior for executable-not-found
